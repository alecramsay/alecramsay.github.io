The 2020 redistricting cycle and my work on DRA has been winding down over the last couple of years:

*   I've been searching for a big juicy new project that I could sink my teeth into. 
*   One thing I've spent a fair amount of time on is trying to figure out
    how to characterize the trade-offs inherent in redistricting a state
    with [Todd Proebsting](http://proebsting.cs.arizona.edu/).
    We've learned a lot, but it's unclear whether we'll be able to characterize the trade-offs as we'd hoped.
    We'll share what we've learned sometime soon.

I welcome suggestions for research & coding opportunities.
