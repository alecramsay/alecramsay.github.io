This is what I'm working on right now:

*	I continue to be involved in [Dave's Redistricting](https://davesredistricting.org) as needed --
	I built the analytics package.
*	I'm working with [Todd Proebsting](http://proebsting.cs.arizona.edu/) and
	[Nick Stephanopoulos](https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/nicholas-stephanopoulos/)
	to characterize some quantitative policy trade-offs inherent in redistricting a state.
*	I'm also working with Todd to flesh out the salient issues in choosing a method for selecting the winner
	in Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) elections.
*	I'm starting [Open Redistricting](https://openredistricting.net) to help ensure that the open redistricting 
	ecosystem as a whole not only survives but thrives through 2032 and beyond.
