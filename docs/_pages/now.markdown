This is what I'm working on:

*	I continue to be involved in [Dave's Redistricting](https://davesredistricting.org) as needed --
	I built the analytics package.
*	I'm helping [Benji Cover](https://www.uidaho.edu/law/people/faculty/bcover) adapt
	[his MM2 idea](https://digitalcommons.law.uidaho.edu/faculty_scholarship/542/) to congressional elections
	by modeling various apportionment schemes in code.
*	I'm working with [Todd Proebsting](http://proebsting.cs.arizona.edu/)	
	to characterize some quantitative policy trade-offs inherent in redistricting a state --
	imagine having a plot of the Pareto frontier for every pair of five DRA ratings dimensions.
*	I'm scoping out another research project with Todd to learn who US voters think should win
	single-winner RCV elections with 3, 4, and 5 candidates and various mixes of ballot preferences -- 
	our hunch is that no single electoral formula always does what people want,
	rather that their method considers several factors.

I welcome other potential research & coding opportunities.
