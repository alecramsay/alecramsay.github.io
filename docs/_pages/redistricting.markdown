Much of my work since retiring has been on redistricting:

*   I spent a couple of years learning everything I could about how redistricting worked.
    I redistricted North Carolina and Maryland by hand using QGIS and Excel.
*   Then I wrote [a series of blog posts](https://medium.com/redistricting-deep-dive)
    in which I did an in-depth analysis of how to get the House to better represent the People, as intended.
*   That led to helping build [Dave's Redistricting (DRA)](https://davesredistricting.org/),
    a web app that makes it easy for anyone to draw & evaluate redistricting plans. 
    I wrote [the analytics code](https://github.com/dra2020/dra-analytics). 
    As part of that effort, I wrote dozens of [blog posts](https://medium.com/dra-2020) about various aspects of the app and redistricting. I continue to be involved in DRA.
*   I published "Estimating Seats-Votes Partisan Advantage" in Election Law Journal
    to explain how to estimate whether redistricting plans favor one political party or the other
    ([ELJ](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/elj.2022.0031), 
    [SSRN](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3996574)).
*   I did a postmortem of redistricting & congressional elections 2012-2020 
    which yielded two surprising results ([post](https://alecramsay.github.io/ushouse/)).
*   I'm doing more independent research & writing on redistricting, with my friend & colleague 
    [Todd Proebsting](http://proebsting.cs.arizona.edu/). 
*   I started [Open Redistricting](https://openredistricting.net/), to help ensure that the open redistricting 
    ecosystem as a whole not only survives but thrives through 2032 and beyond.

I welcome suggestions for other research & coding opportunities.
