Much of my work since retiring has been on redistricting:

* I spent a couple of years learning everything I could about how redistricting worked. I redistricted North Carolina and Maryland by hand using QGIS and Excel.
* I wrote up what I learned in this deep dive in [a series of blog posts](https://medium.com/redistricting-deep-dive).
* Then I spent several years helping build [Dave's Redistricting (DRA)](https://davesredistricting.org/), a web app that makes it easy for anyone to draw & evaluate redistricting plans. I wrote the [analytics code](https://github.com/dra2020/dra-analytics). I also wrote dozens of [blog posts](https://medium.com/dra-2020) about various aspects of the app and redistricting.
* As this redistricting cycle wound down, I wrote a paper that is under review at Election Law Review: [Estimating Seats-Votes Partisan Advantage](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3996574).
* Leveraging all the maps that DRA enabled to be drawn this cycle, I'm currently working on a major research project to characterize the redistricting tradeoffs inherent a state's political geography.

I welcome suggestions for other research topics.
