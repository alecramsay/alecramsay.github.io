This is thumbnail sketch of my career:

* I studied economics and computer science at Williams College (1981).
* I got an MBA from Harvard Business School (1986).
* In my early career (1981-1994), I wrote code in a variety of companies, including a consulting firm, a large healthcare ISV, and three startups (one my own). I became an expert in telecommunications, databases, and AI and built commercial products in LISP and C++.
* I worked at Microsoft (1995-2011) where I led large cross-functional engineering teams on multiple releases of Visual Studio and Windows, led a virtual team that diagnosed the organizational &amp; cultural problems with Vista-era Windows, and co-founded the project that became Windows Azure.
* Since leaving Microsoft, I've been working in the civic tech space ("tech for good"), mostly on redistricting ([Dave's Redistricting](https://davesredistricting.org/)).
