I've also done some work in the broader adjacent issue of representation:

*   I've been helping Benjamin Plener Cover adapt his
    [MM2 idea](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3891735) 
    to the US House of Representatives,
    by modeling various apportionment schemes [in code](https://github.com/alecramsay/MM2).

I welcome suggestions for other research & coding opportunities.
