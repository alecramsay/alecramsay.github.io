I also work in the broader adjacent issue of representation:

*   I've been helping Benjamin Plener Cover adapt his
    [MM2 idea](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3891735) 
    to the US House of Representatives,
    by modeling various apportionment schemes in code.
*   Along with [Todd Proebsting](http://proebsting.cs.arizona.edu/), I write & publish
    [Election Mechanics](https://electionmechanics.substack.com/) in which, among other things,
    we are trying to flesh out the salient issues in choosing a method for selecting the winner 
    in Ranked Choice Voting (RCV) elections
*   I've been asked to help with the research for the 
    [Guinier Project](https://charleshamiltonhouston.org/events/a-convening-race-reform-and-multiracial-democracy/).

I welcome suggestions for other research & coding opportunities.
