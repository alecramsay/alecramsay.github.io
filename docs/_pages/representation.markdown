I'm also starting to dig into the broader adjacent issue of representation:

* I'm helping Benjamin Plener Cover apply his [MM2 idea](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3891735) to the US House of Representatives, by implementing [various apportionment schemes](https://github.com/alecramsay/MM2) in code.
* I also want to analyze the effect that [FairVote's latest multi-member district (MMD) proposal](https://fairvoteaction.org/advocacy-priorities/the-fair-representation-act/fra-sample-maps/) would have on minority and third-party/independent representation.


I welcome suggestions for other research & coding opportunities.
